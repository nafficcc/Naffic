  <h1>Chapter 1: Everything Felt Right</h1>

  <p>
    Zoye had never expected someone like Brad to notice her.
    He was loud, confident, and the kind of boy who seemed to belong to the world. And yet, somehow... he picked her.
    She remembered the first time he called her special. Her heart had thudded in a way that felt dangerous and beautiful all at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    The relationship bloomed quickly - late-night texts, walking hand-in-hand after class, his jacket over her shoulders when it rained.
    For once, Zoye stopped questioning if she was enough.
    Brad made her feel chosen.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Kevin's story was different, but it bloomed with the same hope.
    Lily was spontaneous, full of life. She sent him songs that reminded her of him, made plans without warning, and danced in the middle of quiet roads.
    Kevin - calm, grounded, and always observing - had been pulled into her world like sunlight chasing shadows.
  </p>

  <p>
    She noticed things others didn't.
    "You always overthink before you speak," she'd said once. "But you say the right things."
  </p>

  <p>
    She made him feel interesting. Wanted.
    And Kevin, who had always given love easily, finally felt like it was being given back.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Between all the chaos of falling in love with other people, there was one quiet thing neither of them saw coming:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Each other.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoye and Kevin were never loud about their friendship.
    It wasn't the kind built on daily texts or hours on the phone.
    It was gentle.
    <br><br>
    A kind of understanding most people missed.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    One afternoon, Zoye had been sitting under the stairs after a small fight with Brad - something about him not showing up on time.
    She didn't cry. She just stared at her phone, her fingers still holding onto the last message he hadn't answered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kevin walked by. Stopped.
    Said nothing at first.
    Then, without asking, he sat beside her and handed her a chocolate bar.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You looked like you needed sugar," he said softly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoye let out the tiniest laugh. "You're weird."
  </p>

  <p>
    "Thank you," he smiled, "I work hard for that title."
  </p>

  <p>
    They sat in silence for a while. The chocolate bar unopened in her hand.
    But something in her chest had lightened - just a little.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Another time, Kevin had shared with Zoye how Lily made him feel like home.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoye listened quietly, smiling. "You sound really happy with her."
  </p>

  <p>
    "I am," Kevin had replied.
    <br>
    Then, looking at her, he added, "You and Brad seem good too. Like... opposites that somehow work."
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoye nodded. "He makes me feel less invisible."
  </p>

  <p>
    Kevin looked at her for a moment, serious.
    "You were never invisible. Some people just don't know where to look."
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoye didn't answer. But that sentence stayed with her for days.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    There were more of those quiet moments.
    <br><br>
    A shared bench on rainy days.
    Passing each other notes in class with nothing written but doodles.
    A glance across the hall when things felt off with their partners - not judgmental, just understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    They were each other's quiet place in a world that was growing loud and confusing.
    There were no romantic feelings yet.
    Just a friendship that felt like breath during a storm.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    And at the time, it felt safe.
    Because they were both happy - or at least, they thought they were.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoye still laughed when Brad showed up late with flowers.
    Kevin still smiled when Lily danced around him, teasing his seriousness.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when they talked about their partners, it was with soft eyes and hopeful hearts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything felt right.
    And no one thought it would ever fall apart.
